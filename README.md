# Refactoring the Deterministic Partition Key Function
1. Convert the function to typescript as typescript functions are easier to understand as types are self explanatory.
2. Extracting the repeated logic for creating a hash to a separate function getHash
3. Extracting the logic for finding the candidate partition key to a separate function getCandidate
4. Returning the false condition first to reduce unnecessary condition checks.
5. Adding descriptive variable names and comments to explain the code's purpose
6. I also added unit tests to cover the existing functionality, so that I could be confident that my refactor doesn't break it. The tests check for the different cases in which the function could be called and the expected results, including corner cases such as falsy events and events with partition keys longer than the maximum length. This helps ensure the code's robustness and maintainability in the future.
